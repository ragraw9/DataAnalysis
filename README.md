# Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves complex data analysis using R. It includes data manipulation, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling to derive insights from financial data.

## Key Features
- Data import and cleaning from SAS files.
- Data transformation and filtering based on specific criteria.
- Statistical analysis for financial ratio comparisons.
- Predictive modeling using Generalized Linear Models (GLM).
- Machine learning models including Random Forest, Decision Trees, MARS, and Neural Networks.

## File Structure
- `MainModelingProgram.R`: The main script for the analysis.
- `Memo`: Business memo detailing the insights and implications of the analysis.

## Prerequisites
- R and relevant packages: `fastDummies`, `dplyr`, `MASS`, `rvest`, `XML`, `tidyverse`, `readxl`, `polite`, `haven`, `earth`, `rpart`, `randomForest`, `neuralnet`.

## Data
The analysis is based on financial datasets in SAS format. Update file paths in the script for local data sources.

## Usage
1. Install required R packages.
2. Adjust file paths to your local datasets.
3. Run the script in R or RStudio.

## Analysis Summary
- The project includes data cleaning, variable selection, model building, and prediction.
- Insights are derived from logistic regression and various machine learning models.
- The accompanying memo provides a detailed interpretation of the results.
